# JavaScript CodeWars Challenges

This repository contains a number of CodeWars challenges solved using JavaScript.

All functions have been developed with full TDD using the Jest testing library.

## Challenge descriptions

### bitCounting

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

### geometricProgressionSequence

In your class, you have started lessons about geometric progression. Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will print first n elements of the sequence with the given constant r and first element a.

Result should be separated by comma and space.

Example
geometricSequenceElements(2, 3, 5) == '2, 6, 18, 54, 162'

### multiplesOf3and5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

### pigIt

Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.

Examples
pigIt('Pig latin is cool'); igPay atinlay siay oolcay
pigIt('Hello world !'); elloHay orldway !

### vaccineNation

You have been put in charge of administrating vaccinations for children in your local area. Write a function that will generate a list of vaccines for each child presented for vaccination, based on the child's age and vaccination history, and the month of the year.

- The function takes three parameters: age, status and month
- The parameter 'age' will be given in weeks up to 16 weeks, and thereafter in months. You can assume that children presented will be scheduled for vaccination (eg '16 weeks', '12 months' etc).
- The parameter 'status' indicates if the child has missed a scheduled vaccination, and the argument will be a string that says 'up-to-date', or a scheduled stage (eg '8 weeks') that has been missed, in which case you need to add any missing shots to the list. Only one missed vaccination stage will be passed in per function call.
- If the month is 'september', 'october' or 'november' add 'offer fluVaccine' to the list.
- Make sure there are no duplicates in the returned list, and sort it alphabetically.

Example input and output:
input     ('12 weeks', 'up-to-date', 'december')
output    ['fiveInOne', 'rotavirus']

input     ('12 months', '16 weeks', 'june')
output     ['fiveInOne', 'hibMenC', 'measlesMumpsRubella', 'meningitisB', 'pneumococcal']

input     ('40 months', '12 months', 'october') 
output    ['hibMenC', 'measlesMumpsRubella', 'meningitisB', 'offer fluVaccine', 'preSchoolBooster']

### equalSidesOfAnArray

You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

For example:

Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}: Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.

Input:
An integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.

Output:
The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.

Note:
If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.

### breakCamelCase

Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

Example
solution("camelCasing")  ==  "camel Casing"

### positionsAverage

Suppose you have 4 numbers: '0', '9', '6', '4' and 3 strings composed with them:

s1 = "6900690040"
s2 = "4690606946"
s3 = "9990494604"
Compare s1 and s2 to see how many positions they have in common: 0 at index 3, 6 at index 4, 4 at index 8 ie 3 common positions out of ten.

Compare s1 and s3 to see how many positions they have in common: 9 at index 1, 0 at index 3, 9 at index 5 ie 3 common positions out of ten.

Compare s2 and s3. We find 2 common positions out of ten.

So for the 3 strings we have 8 common positions out of 30 ie 0.2666... or 26.666...%

Given n substrings (n >= 2) in a string s our function pos_average will calculate the average percentage of positions that are the same between the (n * (n-1)) / 2 sets of substrings taken amongst the given n substrings. It can happen that some substrings are duplicate but since their ranks are not the same in s they are considered as different substrings.

The function returns the percentage formatted as a float with 10 decimals but the result is tested at 1e.-9 (see function assertFuzzy in the tests).

Example:
Given string s = "444996, 699990, 666690, 096904, 600644, 640646, 606469, 409694, 666094, 606490" composing a set of n = 10 substrings (hence 45 combinations), pos_average returns 29.2592592593.

In a set the n substrings will have the same length ( > 0 ).

### greatestProduct

Complete the greatestProduct method so that it'll find the greatest product of five consecutive digits in the given string of digits.

For example:

greatestProduct("123834539327238239583") // should return 3240
The input string always has more than five digits.

### sequenceClassifier

A series or sequence of numbers is usually the product of a function and can either be infinite or finite.

In this kata we will only consider finite series and you are required to return a code according to the type of sequence:

0 = unordered e.g. [3,5,8,1,14,3]

1 = strictly increasing e.g. [3,5,8,9,14,23]

2 = not decreasing e.g. [3,5,8,8,14,14]

3 = strictly decreasing e.g. [14,9,8,5,3,1]

4 = not increasing e.g. [14,14,8,8,5,3]

5 = constant e.g. [8,8,8,8,8,8]

You can expect all the inputs to be non-empty and completely numerical arrays/lists - no need to validate the data; do not go for sloppy code, as rather large inputs might be tested.

Try to achieve a good solution that runs in linear time; also, do it functionally, meaning you need to build a pure function or, in even poorer words, do NOT modify the initial input!

### almostEven

We need the ability to divide an unknown integer into a given number of even parts â€” or at least as even as they can be. The sum of the parts should be the original value, but each part should be an integer, and they should be as close as possible.

Example code:

splitInteger(20, 6)  // returns [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]

Complete the function so that it returns an array of integer representing the parts. Ignoring the order of the parts, there is only one valid solution for each input to your function!

(Also, there is no reason to test for edge cases: the input to your function will always be valid for this kata.)

### iNeedMoreSpeed

Write a function that will take in any array and reverse it.

NOTES:

- Array should be reversed in place! (no need to return it)
- Usual builtins have been deactivated. Don't count on them.
- You'll have to do it fast enough, so think about performances

### differenceOf2

The objective is to return all pairs of integers from a given collection of integers that have a difference of 2.

The result should be sorted in ascending order.

The input will consist of unique values. The order of the integers in the input collection should not matter.

Examples
[1, 2, 3, 4]      -->  [[1, 3], [2, 4]]
[4, 1, 2, 3]      -->  [[1, 3], [2, 4]]
[1, 23, 3, 4, 7]  -->  [[1, 3]]
[4, 3, 1, 5, 6]   -->  [[1, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6]]
